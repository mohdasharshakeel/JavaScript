# Big 0 
 - how can we tell if the code isGood code or  Bad code  ? 

 Big 0 - how long an algorithm will take to run and how much memory it will need as the amount of data it handles grows 

 # Exmaple - agar humko mess saaf krna hai to Big 0 notation is like saying how the cleaning time grows as the mess gets bigger 
 

 1. 0(n)  as the number of items in the input data incresses the time it takes for the algorithm to run incresses correspondingly 
  - agar manlo 2 for loop hai aur time complexsity aise ban rhi hai 0(2n) to hum isko 0(n)  hi likhege constant ko drop kar dete hai
